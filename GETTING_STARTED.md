# Getting Started – Next.js Project

This project uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a React-based framework for building modern web applications.

---

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or above recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn] package manager

---

## 1. Install Dependencies

Run this in your project root folder:

```sh
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

---

## 2. Start the Development Server

Start the app in development mode:

```sh
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

---

## 3. Build & Run for Production

To build and run for production:

```sh
npm run build
npm start
```

---

## 4. Environment Variables

If your app uses `.env.local` for secrets or API keys, create this file and add your variables.  
Example:

```
API_URL=https://api.example.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID=your_id
```

---

## 5. Project Structure

Typical Next.js folders and files:

- `/app` or `/pages` – main app/page components
- `/public` – static files
- `/styles` – CSS (often Tailwind)
- `next.config.js` – Next.js config

---

## 6. Useful Commands

```sh
npm run dev      # Start development server
npm run build    # Build for production
npm start        # Start production server
```

---

## 7. Troubleshooting

- If you see errors, check Node.js version and run `npm install` again.
- For port issues, set a custom port: `PORT=4000 npm run dev`
- For TailwindCSS, make sure it's installed and configured in `postcss.config.js` and `tailwind.config.js`.
